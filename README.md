Topping Selector CLI
This Node.js application prompts the user to enter a topping of their choice from a predefined list. It uses the readline module to handle user input from the command line and performs a validation check to ensure the topping is in the list. If the input is valid, it confirms the choice; otherwise, it reports an error.

Features
